# InventorySystem
inventory system with c++ on 4.27.2
An inventory system is a vital component in game projects, allowing players to manage the items they collect. I developed this system using C++ in Unreal Engine and added a few features:

Food items: If a food item already exists in the inventory and the player tries to pick it up again, the system increases its quantity and keeps it in stock. Consuming the food item removes it from the inventory, and when the stock count reaches zero, it disappears completely. Additionally, consuming a food item restores +HP to the player's health.

Vest and helmet: If a vest or helmet is already in the inventory and the player attempts to pick it up again, it replenishes their health to 100. Moreover, when the player's health reaches zero, the vest or helmet breaks, adding a layer of realism and challenge. Also, if the player no longer possesses a vest or helmet, it will be removed from the inventory.

This inventory system allows players to manage their collected items, restore health with food items, and experience the consequences of wearing vests and helmets. It adds depth and immersion to the gameplay, making inventory management a strategic element for survival.
